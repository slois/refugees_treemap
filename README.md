# Refugees and people in a refugee-like situation, excluding asylum-seekers, and changes by origin and country of asylum

This application has been implemented in the context of the Data Visualisation subject of the Master's Degree in Data Science at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). The application implemented in R Shiny shows a **treemap** representation to explore hierarchical data. Treemaps are a data-visualization technique for large, hierarchical data sets. They capture two types of information in the data: (1) the value of individual data points; (2) the structure of the hierarchy. They are made of a series of nested rectangles of sizes proportional to the corresponding data value. A large rectangle represents a branch of a data tree, and it is subdivided into smaller rectangles that represent the size of each node within that branch.

The UN Refugee Agency, [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/), collates population data relating to persons who are forcibly displaced or stateless. The data is sourced primarily from governments and also from UNHCR operations. The app explores this data on refugee displacements between countries of origin and asylum countries obtained from the United Nations refugee agency (unhcr.org) from 1951 to 2022. For more details on the data and the different types of refugee populations considered in the dataset, please see the [methodology](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/methodology/). UNHCR offers a data finder in order to query its dataset [UNHCR Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics).
